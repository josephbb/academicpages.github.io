This course focused on all aspects of physiology including from cellular to organismal levels. In an ecology department, this physiology course took a comparative view in which function was assessed across taxa. As an Assistant in Instruction, I taught the lab portion of the class where students viewed and dissected ethically-sourced specimens, and led a field trip to a conservation park where students were able to interact with Giraffe, Rhinoceros, and Elephants.
