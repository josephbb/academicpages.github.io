This course served as a general introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology. As an Assistant in Instruction, I guided the students through a series of field and laboratory experiments highlighting key concepts in the course. Key themes of the laboratory included understanding ecosystem dynamics, phylogeny, physiology, animal behavior, and game theory.
