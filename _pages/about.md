I'm Joe, a Ph.D. candidate in
<a href="https://eeb.princeton.edu/">Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</a>  at Princeton, advised by <a href="http://collectivebehaviour.com/people/couzin-iain/">Iain Couzin</a> and Dan <a href="https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/daniel-rubenstein">Rubenstein</a>.
<p>
My research is focused on understanding individual behavior and network structure impact broader patterns of collective behavior. Of particular interest is the impact of emerging technology on social processes. Smart phones and social media connect us in novel and rapidly changing ways, altering how we share and access information.

<p>
Historically my research has involved understanding multi-sensory integration, collective behavior in fish schools, but is increasingly focused on understanding human behavioral dynamics. Ongoing projects involve the impact of polarization and partisanship on collective wisdom and how incentives impact collective decision-making. My work relies on insight from the study of animal behavior as well as online experiments, Bayesian Inference and computational models.
