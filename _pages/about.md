Joe is a Ph.D. candidate in
<a href="https://eeb.princeton.edu/">Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</a>  at Princeton, advised by <a href="http://collectivebehaviour.com/people/couzin-iain/">Iain Couzin</a> and Dan <a href="https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/daniel-rubenstein">Rubenstein</a>.

His research is focused on understanding the impact of the Anthropocene on human collective behavior. Smart phones and social media connect us in novel and rapidly changing ways, altering how we share and access information. His work focuses on understanding the functional consequences these changes in order to provide industry and regulators with actionable insight into safe adoption of new technology. To accomplish this, he relies on insight from the study of animal behavior as well as online experiments, Bayesian Inference and computational models.
